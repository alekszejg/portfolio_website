DEVELOPMENT STAGE GOALS:
- Individual Project Pages: add gap between image and text for project features
- Portfolio Website Page: add images


BEFORE PRODUCTION CHECK: 
- Ensure colors are as bright as intended on mobile systems and other computers, since changing my monitor contrast significantly changed how colors are shown 
- Nginx: calculate total HTTP requests per page and get rate limiting to work


AFTER PRODUCTION STAGE GOALS:
- Homepage: fix insignificant automatic scrollbar movements in 'Stack' component when clcking buttons
with significantly smaller or larger text content. Im 99.9% sure issue is in Link functionality of SkillLogo component which sends user to center of 'Stack' component, which is done on purpose but is interuptive when
user is already on the page and tries to clcika dnr ead everything

- Homepage: background art could use deeper 3D effect

- Navbar Logo: make lighter or change it completely

- Next-chat Project Page: needs to be made

- Log Management: do some research and start applying knowledge 

AFTER PRODUCTION STAGE (OPTIONAL GOALS): 
- Pages for specific blogposts should show posts from same category, if nothing [] then show recent posts

- Make post links as search params instead of dynamic routes (/blogposts/?post=ID) 

- View more button for blogposts can be replaced with load on scroll
