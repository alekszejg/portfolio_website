TODO LIST 

General 
1) Seek for ways to minimize client-side code and increase server-side code
2) Check how to turn post links into search param instead of dynamic (/blogposts/?post=ID) 
3) Page for specific posts should show posts from same category, if nothing [] then show recent posts


Design and Styling
1) Homepage mobile design (+desktop) should be ready by end of 20/09/24
2) Think about integrating contact form as widget rather than separate page (similar to Mangopost project, maybe even add whatsapp too)
3) Think of alternative to view more buttom for blog


JTW Authentification + Authorization (leave for later)
1) Tokens need to be renewed after some period
2) API routes (post submit POST request route needs to check authorization before posting)


Don't forget
1) Submit blogpost api route is missing (split submit code from form validation code in server action)
2) Portfolio project page about Mangopost website (+ restyle all project pages so leave for later)
