CURRENT GOALS / STEPS
1) Finish desktop hero section for each project page (just missing 2 buttons, to github and 'scroll down')
2) Do rough mobile styling for hero section of each project, make it vertical
3) Overview section of each project must have alrger margins, figure out appropriate styling for mobile
4) Do features for Portfolio Website project (add photos later)
5) Mangopost website project page needs OverView section and media related to it, also add features (talk about UX/UI)
6) (Optional before production) Next-chat website could use rough structure outline
7) Replace homepage profile photo, make it not blurry
8) Replace homepage background photo (move text to right so it was fully visible)
9) Come up with basic logo for website (simialr to homepage background would do)
10) Before checking blogpost section again, move to next auth v5 beta and Next.js 15, fix mistakes that occured from using old synchronous approach + add new async approach

SOON
- JWT tokens must be renewed periodically
- For safety blogpost submission action should have authorization system

LEAVE FOR LATER
- Pages for specific blogposts should show posts from same category, if nothing [] then show recent posts
- Make post links as search params instead of dynamic routes (/blogposts/?post=ID) 
- View more button for blogposts can be replaced with load on scroll
