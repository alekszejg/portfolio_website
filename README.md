CURRENT GOALS
- Server Actions: verify frontend and backend logic once more (do useActionState instead?)
- Test Rate Limit: create python script or curl it 
- Database: after all testing, clean it, backup it, load it into volume again  


LATER GOALS:
- Homepage: fix insignificant automatic scrollbar movements in 'Stack' component when clcking buttons
with significantly smaller or larger text content. Im 99.9% sure issue is in Link functionality of SkillLogo component which sends user to center of 'Stack' component, which is done on purpose but is interuptive when
user is already on the page and tries to clcika dnr ead everything

- Homepage: background art could use deeper 3D effect

- Navbar Logo: make lighter or change it completely

- Next-chat Project Page: needs to be made

- Log Management: do some research and start applying knowledge 

AFTER PRODUCTION STAGE (OPTIONAL GOALS): 
- Pages for specific blogposts should show posts from same category, if nothing [] then show recent posts

- Make post links as search params instead of dynamic routes (/blogposts/?post=ID) 

- View more button for blogposts can be replaced with load on scroll
