CURRENT GOALS

General 
- Keep minimizing client-side code and increase server-side code

Soon
- Add contact form as widget on homepage (perhaps on interactive CV, not as separate webpage)
- JWT tokens must be renewed periodically
- For safety blogpost submission action should have authorization system
- Pages for finished projects should be unique in design 

For later
- Pages for specific blogposts should show posts from same category, if nothing [] then show recent posts
- Make post links as search params instead of dynamic routes (/blogposts/?post=ID) 
- View more button for blogposts can be replaced with load on scroll 

Finished 
- Interactive CV Page
- API Routes (check if server actions are reasonable)
