AWESOME NEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- After 2 days with little breaks I finally managed to get nginx running with
new vhost for alexeyguljajev.com domain and issued SSL to it. After knowing it can be published with just few clicks all is left rn is some polishing (visual improvement + security) 


CURRENT GOALS / STEPS
- ( IMPORTANT ) Before production ensure colors are as bright as intended on mobile systems and other computers, since
changing my monitor contrast significantly changed how colors are shown 

- Homepage: improve contact form design, tweak existing styles

- Homepage: more formal profile image needed

- Interactive CV: more formal profile image needed

- Interactive CV: simplify props logic and 'styling' object

- Project Pages: add mobile styling (aka vertical version but slightly more creative) to hero and overview sections

- Project Pages: add gap between image and text for project features

- Portfolio Website Page: add text content for its UI/UX features

- Portfolio Website Page: add photos at the end when almost done

- Security: learn to calculate and apply Nginx rate limiting efficiently

- Security: familiarize myself with log management, have better control of cronjobs and running docker contains + more knowledge needed of nginx

- (Optional) homepage background art could use deeper 3D effect 
- (Optional) logo could be lighter, same as background, overall could be more creative...
- (Optional) Next-chat Website Page: could start structural outline



WHEN MOST OF GOALS ARE DONE
- Pages for specific blogposts should show posts from same category, if nothing [] then show recent posts
- Make post links as search params instead of dynamic routes (/blogposts/?post=ID) 
- View more button for blogposts can be replaced with load on scroll
