CURRENT GOALS
- Test Rate Limit: create python script or curl it 
- Database: after all testing, clean it, backup it, load it into volume again  


LATER GOALS:
- Homepage: fix insignificant automatic scrollbar movements in 'Stack' component when clcking buttons
with significantly smaller or larger text content. Im 99.9% sure issue is in Link functionality of SkillLogo component which sends user to center of 'Stack' component, which is done on purpose but is interuptive when
user is already on the page and tries to clcika dnr ead everything
- Homepage: background art could use deeper 3D effect

- Next-chat Project Page: needs to be made

- Blog: individual blog pages and blog section should be publicly accessible
- Blog: blogpost pages should show posts from same category, if nothing [] then show recent posts
- Blog: make postIDs in URLS as search params instead of dynamic routes (/blogposts/?post=ID) 
- Blog: add view more posts button (on homepage they can be loaded based on scrolling) 

- Log Management: do some research and start applying knowledge
